=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to deletes a specified instance profile.
    The instance profile must not have an associated role. Make sure you do not
    have any Amazon EC2 instance running with this instance profile you are
    about to delete. Deleting a role or instance profile that is associated with
    a running instance will break any applications running on that instance.
