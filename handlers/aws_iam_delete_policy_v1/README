=== Detailed Description
  This handler is used to delete a specified managed policy.  Before you
  can delete a managed policy, you must detach the policy from all users,
  groups, and roles that it is attached to, and you must delete all of the
  policy's versions. The entire ARN, not just the number or name is taken
  as a parameter input. For more information see the AWS Amazon Virtual
  Private Cloud User Guide online.
