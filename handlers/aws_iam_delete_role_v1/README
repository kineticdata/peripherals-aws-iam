=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to delete a specified role.  The role
    must not have any policies attached.  Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2
    instances running with the role you are about to delete. Deleting a role or
    instance profile that is associated with a running instance will break any
    applications running on the instance.  For more information see the AWS
    Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide online.
