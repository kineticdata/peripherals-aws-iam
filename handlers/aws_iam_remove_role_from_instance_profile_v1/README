=== Detailed Description
    This handler uses the AWS REST API to remove a specified role from a
    specified instance profile. Make sure you do not have any Amazon EC2
    instances running with the role you are about to remove from the instance
    profile. Removing a role from an instance profile that is associated with a
    running instance will break any applications running on the instance.
